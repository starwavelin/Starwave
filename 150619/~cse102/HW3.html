                    The popularity of smartphones in the United States is primarily due to its combined
                    functionalities of a traditional cell phone 
                    and various local and online 
                    <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/10/earlyshow/saturday/main6664604.shtml">applications</a>
                    within it.
                    Many world-leading traditional mobile phone developing companies, such as
                    <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/">Nokia</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.motorola.com/us">Motorola</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a>,
                    and some huge software service corporations
                    like 
                    <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> and
                    <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>,
                    have all stepped into this smartphone market.
                    The diversity of smartphone providers gives domestic consumers various
                    alternatives; meanwhile, the competition between those smartphone
                    providers becomes hotter day by day. This paper is trying to find out
                    which company would become the potential champion in this race,
                    ultimately occupying the biggest cake in this market.

                    From a technical review, Android series is a little more outstanding than 
                    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/">iOS</a>
                    (the operating system that iPhone uses).
                    According to the <a href="http://www.comscore.com/">ComScore</a>
                    survey, during the period from the third quarter to the fourth quarter
                    in 2010, Android-equipped phone experienced a market share leap of 7.7%,
                    compared merely 0.1% of Apple’s iPhone.<sup>[1]</sup>
                    This is due to the efficiency of most applications supported by Android.

                    Taking a comparison of web browsers of the two type phones for example,
                    Samsung’s Nexus S, an Android OS phone is 84% faster than iPhone 4 in browsing the same extensive
                    amount of web pages.<sup>[2]</sup> 
                    
                    Although some Apple officers argue that the comparison did not use
                    iPhone’s powerful Safari, this again reveals Apple’s limitation in application development,
                    because outside developers could only custom applications of an iPhone through 
                    <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html">
                        UIWebView</a>,
                    which allows developers to embed web content
                    into an app yet denies synchronized updates with Apple’s core browser –
