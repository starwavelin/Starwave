                        <q>Three Lanes and Seven Alleys</q> is a series of traditional streets which can be
                        dated to the 4<sup>th</sup> century. Today, most ancient buildings in this district
                        were constructed in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). In the
                        year 2006, the City Government of Fuzhou spent over 400 million Chinese currency to
                        renew all the buildings in this district. This huge project was finished in 2010.
                        Today, this old series of streets received a renowned title as <q>One of the Top 10
                        Chinese Old Streets</q>.

                        <q>Black Tower</q> is a tower built by granite during the period of the Kingdom of Min (909-945).
                        After over a thousand year's air-slaking, the body of the tower turns into black; that
                        is why local people called it Black Tower.

                        This tower was built under the order of a king of Min
                        in honor of Buddhism. Today, the Buddhist figures and
                        ancient calligraphy inside the tower are valuable for historical studies.
