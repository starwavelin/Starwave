                    For Android, this type of issue would rarely happen. This is because
                    Google has made Android available under a free <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">open source</a>
                    license since 2008
                    so that both Google developers and outside
                    smart computer intellectuals are able to maintain and update this
                    operating system collaboratively.<sup>[3]</sup>

                <p class="left">In regards of customer satisfaction,
                    iPhone has been No.1 for the fifth time, according to the
                    J.D. Power and Associates 2011 U.S. Wireless Smartphone Customer Satisfaction Study,
                    yet Android-equipped phones do not fall too behind in the same field.<sup>[4]</sup>
                    Based on this study, iPhone earned
                    795 points of satisfaction out of 1000 from those consumers surveyed,
                    and the following two phones, Motorola and HTC,
                    which both embed Android OS, earned 763 points and 762 points, respectively.

                    In promotions, both iPhone and Android make a lot of efforts.
                    This spring, the debut of <q>White iPhone</q> would again make those
                    iPhone fans excited and lined up in front of an electronic store.<sup>[5]</sup>
                    However, According to Millennial Media, Android is the champion in ad impressions,
                    which has 51% share, almost the twice of Apple’s 27%.<sup>[6]</sup>
                </p>
                <p class="left">
                    The result of a long-term competition sometimes comes from the soft power of
                    two entities rather than the hard power. When considering the two firms both developing smartphones,
                    stewardship within the organization also affects the products they bring out.
                    Although Apple Inc. publishes little on <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a>’
                    health,
                    the outside can make an inference that the absence of this key figure would greatly
                    affect his empire, because most product designs need to be finally approved by Jobs,
                    this technology genius who has a particular taste in art, to implement.<sup>[7]</sup>
                    Without this “emperor,” even apple fans can hardly imagine what would next iPhone
                    is going to be. In contrast, after <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/larry-page">Larry Page</a>
                    took the crosier from <a href="http://ericschmidt.com/">Eric Schmidt</a>,
                    this flexible smart CEO started plan trying to set Google back to China
                    and recruit more developers for Android.<sup>[8]</sup>
                    We can imagine when Mr. Page someday puts the “<a href="http://www.google.com/phone/#">Google phone</a>”
                    development
                    into his agenda, using Android OS which has been tested in many other vendors,
                    the Android-equipped phone would welcome its golden age.

                    Therefore, the competition between these two giant smartphone providers
                    remains in process. And, the performance of the two is basically neck in neck
                    in the marketing domain, with Google Inc. taking a little more advantage
                    in technology performance of the smartphone operating system and the
                    soft power of the organization management. We may infer that Google has a higher
                    chance than Apple to win the championship in the smartphone market in the future.
                    However, as many other papers on market predictions, this paper can only provide
                    an inference based on the limited clues we could obtain. As an idiom says,
                    <q>Let the future determine the future; we just go and see.</q>
